# Troubleshooting: SMS Not Sending

## Problem
When clicking "Send Now" on a reminder schedule, the SMS is not being sent to the elderly person's phone.

## Root Cause
The **Africa's Talking API credentials** are not configured in your Supabase project. The SMS and voice call edge functions require these credentials to communicate with Africa's Talking API.

## Solution

### Step 1: Sign Up for Africa's Talking

#### For Testing (Free Sandbox):
1. Visit [https://africastalking.com/](https://africastalking.com/)
2. Click "Sign Up" and create a free account
3. You'll automatically get access to the **Sandbox** environment
4. No credit card required for sandbox testing

#### For Production (Paid):
1. Visit [https://africastalking.com/](https://africastalking.com/)
2. Sign up and verify your account
3. Purchase SMS credits (pricing varies by country)
4. Create a production application

### Step 2: Get Your API Credentials

1. **Log in** to your Africa's Talking account
2. Go to your **Dashboard**
3. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Key**

   - **Username**: 
     - For sandbox: `sandbox`
     - For production: Your actual username (shown in dashboard)

---

### Step 3: Configure Credentials in Supabase

You should have received a prompt to configure these secrets. If not, follow these steps:

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Project Settings** → **Edge Functions** → **Secrets**
3. Add the following secrets:

   **Secret 1:**
   - Name: `AFRICASTALKING_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your API key from Africa's Talking (e.g., `atsk_1234567890abcdef...`)

   **Secret 2:**
   - Name: `AFRICASTALKING_USERNAME`
   - Value: 
     - For sandbox: `sandbox`
     - For production: Your actual username

4. **Save** the secrets

### Step 4: Register Test Phone Numbers (Sandbox Only)

If you're using the sandbox environment, you must register phone numbers before sending SMS to them:

1. Log in to Africa's Talking
2. Go to **Sandbox** → **Voice & SMS**
3. Click **Add Phone Number**
4. Enter the phone number in international format: `+254712345678`
5. Verify the phone number (you'll receive an OTP)
6. Repeat for all test phone numbers
